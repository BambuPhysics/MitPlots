The Tree-Analysis-Module (TAM) framework is an independent package 
developed with three main goals in mind:
    * First, to provide a very general, modular framework for analyzing data in ROOT trees.
    * Second, to ensure compatibility with Proof and allow users to switch between Proof-based 
      and Proof-less analysis with as much ease as possible.
    * Third, to hide, as much as possible, all direct interaction with the tree itself from the user. 

Its main twiki page is at http://www.cmsaf.mit.edu/twiki/bin/view/Software/TAM.
The current revision from which we branched of is: Revision 5584.

If you think you found a bug, please send an email to loizides@mit.edu.
Please note that the coding conventions used for TAM do not necessarily
coincide with what we use for MitAna.
