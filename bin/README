Differences between local condor and crab submission
====================================================

Crab does a number of things that for condor you need to do by hand. On the other hand in condor
there are a number of things you can do but you cannot do in crab. Ideally we would map our condor
submission exactly into crab but that might not be what we want to do in the long run and with crab3
looming it might be a waste. So here we are going to adjust what is needed and later see how to more
coherently integrate.

BOTH
  $globDir/${CMSSW_VERSION}-src.tgz   # tar of $CMSSW_BASE/src excluding MitPhysics/data
  $globDir/external.tgz
  $globDir/json.tgz
  catalog.tgz
  $globDir/.rootlogon.C
  $globDir/$runMacro
  $globDir/${runMacroTrunc}_C.so
  $globDir/${runMacroTrunc}_C.d

CRAB
  runCrab.sh                    # master script to call runCrabJob.sh with arguments
  runCrabJob.sh                 # equivalent of run.sh in condor setup (maybe it should be a copy?)
  arguments.list                # generated for each dataset to define arguments list for each job
  setup.sh                      # generated for each dataset to define environment variables

CONDOR
  run.sh                        # master script to run the job
  $x509File                     # take care of authentication ourselves (check condor options)
  $globDir/${CMSSW_VERSION}.tgz # tar of $CMSSW_BASE/{external,lib}

When we create an analysis task and process the various datasets for submission, all of the above
files will be created so they are ready for packing up. Each task submission (crab or condor) will
be able to pick the tasks it needs.

Advantages/Diadvantages:

CRAB
  + any computing site is available
  + will be properly tracked in dashboard (at least it should be, run summary might be inadequate)
  - huge number of parallel jobs might affect the input at MIT as they have to be copied (caching or
    read through xrootd)
  - monitoring of jobs is painful
  - completing started tasks has to wait for completion of last step
  - logging information is not available in convenient format

CONDOR
  + convenient and powerful monitoring
  + completion of started tasks are trivial and can be done on the fly
  - limited resources (MIT Tier2 and Tier3 only)
  - no dashboard tracking
